# RTL to GDSII Implementation of Universal Shift Register
Description:

RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System Information Interchange) is the process of converting a Digital Circuit Design described at the RTL level into a Binary File representing physical layout suitable for manufacturing of Integrated Circuits (IC).

HDL: Verilog

EDA Tools: Cadence Innovus, Cadence Genus and Cadence Incisive

Results:

• Designed a synthesizable RTL of Universal Shift Register using Verilog.

• Wrote a Verilog Testbench for behavioral simulation using Cadence Incisive.

• Synthesized the design by setting timing constraints using Cadence Genus.

• Floor Planning, Power Planning, Placement, Clock Tree Synthesis, Timing Analysis, Routing, RC Extraction and GDSII file creation carried out using Cadence Innovus
